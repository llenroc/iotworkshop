## With code
Of course, you can also register devices via code to integrate device registration in your wokrflows or create your very own registration tool.

**Important:** Due to security reasons, devices should *never* gegister themselves at the IoT Hub. For the device registration, are *registry write* permissions required, that should not be given to a single device. Especially in case of a stolen or corrupted device, it is important, to exclude the device without giving it the chance to re-register.
