### Additional rerequisites
In this module, we dive a little bit deeper into electrical engeneering and work with the GPIO pins directly instead of using a preconfigured shield like the FEZ Hat. For this, we need some basic additional stuff:
- Breadboard
- 1 single colored LED
- 220 Ohm resistor
- 2 male-female jumper cables
