# Setting up
### 1. Install Windows IoT Core on your Raspberry Pi
Due the Raspberry Pi has now own storage beside the MicroSD card, the opertating system can only be installed there. This has the advantage that you are able to hot swap opertaing systems and different evironments on your Pi by simply replacing the card.

To provision a MicroSD card with Windows IoT core, you can simply insert the card into your card reader and open the Windows 10 IoT Core Dashboard app. Navigate to *Set up a new device* and fill out the form. If your PC has a Wi-Fi module, you can directly set up a Wi-Fi connection for your Pi here. If you do so, the device automatically connects to the selected network as soon as it gets booted for the first time

> **Hint:** You can only select those Wi-Fi networks, your host has been connected to at some time. To connect your Raspberry Pi to a network that is not listet, connect your host PC to it first.
