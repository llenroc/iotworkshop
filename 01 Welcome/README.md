# Welcome ðŸŽ‰
Hi and welcome! It is good to see you here at this Windows 10 IoT Core workshop. My name is Robin-Manuel Thiel and I will guide you through the next hours of learning cool stuff.

In the following modules, you will learn a lot about IoT devices like the Raspberry Pi and how to communicate with and create applications for them. You will get to know Microsoft's IoT offering in the cloud and will manage your devices remotely with Microsoft Azure and you will create a real end-to-end solution that measures data on a Raspberry Pi, sends them to the cloud, processes and visualizes it there and sends data back to the device.

Sounds good? Then let us take a look at what you can expect!

## What you can expect
As promised before, we will create a real end-to-end solution in this workshop: With the FEZ Hat we will read temperature data on a Raspberry Pi and send them to an Azure IoT Hub. Here we process the data and will visualize them in some ways (regarding on your path). We will also learn how to manage devices with the Azure IoT Hub and how to send messages back to the device so that we can react on it. For demonstration purposes this will be a color code that the Raspberry will use on an LED as soon as it received the message.

What you will learn strongly depends on the learning path you choose. Every path has its own *What you will learn* section that you can check out.

## How to work with this workshop
You already did the first step into the right direction and found this Welcoming Module. That means that you might have already chosen a suitable workshop path for you.

Each path has a number of modules that will guide you through the learning experience step by step. Whichever path you chose, they will all guide you to the same results but focus on different aspects and deepness of the end-to-end solution. Just work off your path's modules in the given order. Just click on the module link in your path overview and come back when you have finished to get started with the next one.
