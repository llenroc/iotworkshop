## 3. Visualize data in Power BI (optional)
> **Hint:** For this step, you will need Power BI access which currently comes as a part of a Office 365 subscription. If your subscription does not contain Power BI yet, you can [get a trial here](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/de-de/). If you don't have a Office 365 subscription, you can still follow this step by just reading the instructions.
